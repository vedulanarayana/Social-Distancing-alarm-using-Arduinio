In this project I have connected ultrasonic sensor to buzzer and arduino to take care of social distancing.
# Required Components:
  1.Arduino Uno
  2.HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
  3.Piezo Buzzer
  4.Breadboard
  5.Battery Supply
 # Connections:
    * Ultrasonic Sensor :
      1.Vcc to 5V of Arduino
      2.GND to GND of Arduino
      3. Trigger pin to pin 12 of Arduino
      4. Echo pin to pin 13 of Arduino
    * Piezo Buzzer:
      1.NEGATIVE (Black) to GND of Arduino
      2.POSITIVE(red) to pin 8 of Arduino
